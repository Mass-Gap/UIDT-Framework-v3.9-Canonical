# 📖 UIDT Glossary & Definitions (Canonical v3.9)

A reference guide to the terminology used in the Unified Information-Density Theory (v3.9 - Clean State).

## A-M

* **99-Step RG Cascade:** The hierarchical renormalization group flow that steps down the vacuum energy density by  factors across multiple scales. This mechanism bridges the 120-order-of-magnitude gap between the Planck scale and the observed cosmological constant .
* **Banach Fixed-Point Audit:** The numerical verification process (residuals ) ensuring that the 3-Equation System possesses a unique, stable, and mathematically closed solution at .
* **Canonical Parameters:** The immutable set of values () derived strictly from the **3-Equation System** without external empirical fitting.
* **Clean State:** The definitive, verified state of the theory established after the formal withdrawal of v3.3. It signifies full personal control over data integrity and the removal of all external formatting errors.
* **CSF-UIDT Duality:** The synthesis between Covariant Scalar-Field (CSF) theory and UIDT. UIDT provides the non-perturbative QFT core, while CSF ensures manifest covariance on macroscopic scales.
* **Deep Well:** The global stability minimum in the scalar potential  at the rectified VEV of **47.7 MeV**, where the information-density field is in equilibrium.
* **Gamma Invariant ():** The universal scaling factor () connecting the Yang-Mills mass gap to the kinetic vacuum density. It governs the scaling relations across all physical domains: .
* **Holographic Scale ():** The fundamental unit of geometric information density, calculated at **0.66 nm**. It serves as the characteristic length for Casimir anomaly predictions and holographic entropy bounds.

## N-Z

* **Pillar I (QFT):** The microscopic foundation of UIDT, focusing on the analytical derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap and non-perturbative gauge-field coupling.
* **Pillar II (Lattice Topology & Missing Link):** The discrete lattice structure underlying the vacuum, characterized by the Torsion Binding Energy E_T ≈ 2.44 MeV. This "Missing Link" resolves the geometric-field coupling and stabilizes the vacuum against classical collapse.
* **Pillar III (Laboratory):** The experimental verification layer. It includes specific, falsifiable predictions such as the **Category D** Casimir anomaly and glueball-like resonances at .
* **Pillar IV (Photonic):** The analog verification layer using photonic metamaterials with critical-index relations anchored to the Gamma invariant.
* **SMDS (Supermassive Dark Seeds):** Primordial concentrations of information density () that explain the rapid formation of early galaxies as observed by JWST.
* **Three-Equation System:** The coupled non-linear system consisting of (1) Vacuum Stability, (2) Schwinger-Dyson-Gap, and (3) Fixed-Point Renormalization. Solving this system yields the mass gap .
* **Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV):** The rectified equilibrium value of the information field . In v3.9, this value is fixed at **47.7 MeV** (Appendix O) to ensure consistency with the Standard Model Higgs-sector and mass-gap closure.
