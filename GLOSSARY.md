# 📖 UIDT Glossary & Definitions (Canonical v3.7.3)

A reference guide to the terminology used in the Unified Information-Density Theory (v3.7.3 - Clean State).

## A-M

* **99-Step RG Cascade:** The hierarchical renormalization group flow that steps down the vacuum energy density by  factors across multiple scales. This mechanism bridges the 120-order-of-magnitude gap between the Planck scale and the observed cosmological constant .
* **Banach Fixed-Point Audit:** The numerical verification process (residuals ) ensuring that the 3-Equation System possesses a unique, stable, and mathematically closed solution at .
* **Canonical Parameters:** The immutable set of values () derived strictly from the **3-Equation System** without external empirical fitting.
* **Clean State:** The definitive, verified state of the theory established in v3.7.3 after the formal withdrawal of v3.3. It signifies full personal control over data integrity and the removal of all external formatting errors.
* **CSF-UIDT Duality:** The synthesis between Covariant Scalar-Field (CSF) theory and UIDT. UIDT provides the non-perturbative QFT core, while CSF ensures manifest covariance on macroscopic scales.
* **Deep Well:** The global stability minimum in the scalar potential  at the rectified VEV of **47.7 MeV**, where the information-density field is in equilibrium.
* **Gamma Invariant ():** The universal scaling factor () connecting the Yang-Mills mass gap to the kinetic vacuum density. It governs the scaling relations across all physical domains: .
* **Holographic Scale ():** The fundamental unit of geometric information density, calculated at **0.66 nm**. It serves as the characteristic length for Casimir anomaly predictions and holographic entropy bounds.

## N-Z

* **Pillar I (QFT):** The microscopic foundation of UIDT, focusing on the analytical derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap and non-perturbative gauge-field coupling.
* **Pillar II (Cosmology):** The macroscopic application, providing a unified solution to the Hubble Tension () and the Vacuum Energy Catastrophe.
* **Pillar III (Laboratory):** The experimental verification layer. It includes specific, falsifiable predictions such as the **Category D** Casimir anomaly and glueball-like resonances at .
* **SMDS (Supermassive Dark Seeds):** Primordial concentrations of information density () that explain the rapid formation of early galaxies as observed by JWST.
* **Three-Equation System:** The coupled non-linear system consisting of (1) Vacuum Stability, (2) Schwinger-Dyson-Gap, and (3) Fixed-Point Renormalization. Solving this system yields the mass gap .
* **Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV):** The rectified equilibrium value of the information field . In v3.7.3, this value is fixed at **47.7 MeV** (Appendix O) to ensure consistency with the Standard Model Higgs-sector and mass-gap closure.
