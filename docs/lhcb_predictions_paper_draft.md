# Parameter-Free Predictions for Fully-Heavy Exotic Hadrons from Vacuum Information Density Theory

**Draft Version:** UIDT TICK-20260224 Roadmap
**Target Journal:** TBD (Post-Run 3 LHCb results)

## Abstract
We present two parameter-free, fully rigid mass predictions for the fully-heavy $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryon and the $T_{cccc}$ tetraquark state, derived strictly from the Unified Information-Density Topology (UIDT) vacuum structure. Unlike phenomenological potential models or lattice QCD methods that rely on fitted interpolating fields, these predictions arise from the exact harmonic resonance of the non-perturbative geometric mass gap. We define explicit falsifiable boundaries for the upcoming high-luminosity LHCb measurements.

## 1. Introduction: The UIDT Spectral Framework
The UIDT framework establishes a continuous mapping between the Yang-Mills mass gap $\Delta^* = 1.710 \text{ GeV}$ and the microscopic vacuum topological resonance frequency $f_{vac} \approx 107.10 \text{ MeV}$. This anchor requires the strict topological folding rule observed across the multiquark states via harmonic octave scaling.

## 2. Triple-Bottom Baryon ($\Omega_{bbb}$) Prediction
Employing the 3-6-9 harmonic scaling sequence:
$$ M(\Omega_{bbb}) = 135 \times f_{vac} = 14.4585 \pm 0.07 \text{ GeV} $$
The strict deviation bound $(\pm 0.07 \text{ GeV})$ is propagated directly from the uncertainty in the lattice torsion binding energy $E_T$.

**Comparison:** Standard QCD potentials predict a wider window $[14.3, 14.8]$ GeV. LHCb isolation of this resonance below $14.2$ or above $14.7$ GeV constitutes immediate falsification of the harmonic geometric topology.

## 3. Fully-Charmed Tetraquark ($T_{cccc}$)
The tetraquark geometric node adheres to the $N=42$ fundamental harmonic:
$$ M(T_{cccc}) = 42 \times f_{vac} = 4.4982 \pm 0.02 \text{ GeV} $$

**Comparison:** Lattice studies frequently place $T_{cccc}$ in the higher range of $[5.8, 6.2]$ GeV. The UIDT assigns this resonance to an explicitly lower vacuum harmonic state purely based on information density conservation bounds. Finding the lowest mass fully-charmed tetraquark state above $5.0$ GeV strictly refutes this prediction.

## 4. Experimental Testability (LHC Run 3/4)
We challenge the high-energy physics community to test these exact harmonic bounds. As pure "Category D" blind predictions, they act as the ultimate discriminant between traditional quark-model phenomenology and information-density harmonic geometry.
