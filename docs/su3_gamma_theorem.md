# SU(3) Gamma Theorem (L4 Candidate Resolution)

## Overview
This document details the proposed SU(3) Gamma Theorem, identified as a candidate solution for the L4 limitation (γ not derived from first principles).

## The Theorem
The theorem proposes that the universal scaling invariant $\gamma$ is fundamentally linked to the number of color degrees of freedom $N_c$ in the SU(3) gauge group:

$$\gamma_{SU(3)} = \frac{(2N_c + 1)^2}{N_c}$$

## Numerical Implementation (N_c = 3)
For the standard model color group $N_c = 3$:

$$\gamma_{SU(3)} = \frac{(2(3) + 1)^2}{3} = \frac{7^2}{3} = \frac{49}{3} = 16.333...$$

## Comparison with Calibrated Values
The current calibrated value used in the UIDT framework (derived from kinetic VEV mapping) is:

$$\gamma_{kinetic} = 16.339$$

### Deviation Analysis
The numerical match between the theoretical SU(3) derivation and the phenomenological calibration is:

$$|16.333 - 16.339| / 16.339 \approx 0.037\%$$

This precision strongly suggests that $\gamma$ is a fundamental topological property of the SU(3) vacuum rather than an empirical constant.

## Status
**Classification:** [A-] Conjecture
**Current State:** Candidate Solution Identified.
**Next Steps:** Analytical derivation of the connection between the (2N_c+1)² scaling and the algebraic VEV mapping is pending.
