# Parameter-Free heavy Quark Spectroscopy Predictions

**Version:** TICK-20260224-Phase3_Discoveries
**Evidence Category:** [D] (Blind Prediction, Awaiting LHCb Confirmation)

## Derivation Chain

The predictions rely explicitly on the harmonic scaling of the derived vacuum resonance frequency (Phase 2, Pillar III).

```
Δ* = 1.710 GeV  [A]
  ↓  ÷ γ = 16.339  [A-]
E_geo = 104.66 MeV  [A-]
  ↓  + E_torsion = 2.44 MeV  [C]
f_vac = 107.10 MeV  [C]
  ↓  × 135  (3-6-9 Octave Scaling)
M(Ω_bbb) = 14.4585 ± 0.07 GeV  [D]
  ↓  × 42
M(cccc) = 4.4982 ± 0.02 GeV  [D]
```

## Comparison with Existing Models

| State | UIDT v3.9 | Lattice QCD | Potential Model | Experiment |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| $\Omega_{bbb}$ | **14.4585 ± 0.07 GeV** | 14.37–14.57 GeV | 14.3–14.8 GeV | Not Measured |
| $T_{cccc}$ | **4.4982 ± 0.02 GeV** | 5.6–6.2 GeV | 5.0–6.5 GeV | Not Measured |

> **Note:** The $T_{cccc}$ predicted mass lies notably below most standard Lattice QCD variations. This presents a stern, high-risk falsification vector.

## Falsification Triggers

- If LHCb measures $M(\Omega_{bbb}) \notin [14.2, 14.7]$ GeV, the 3-6-9 octave scaling hypothesis for triple-bottom is refuted.
- If LHCb measures $M(T_{cccc}) > 5.0$ GeV, the harmonic tetraquark scaling rule is falsified.
