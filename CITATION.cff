abstract: "UIDT v3.9 presents a publication-ready synthesis of Unified Information-Density Theory (UIDT) with a Four-Pillar Architecture: (1) a mathematically closed derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap (Δ≈1.710 GeV) verified by constructive fixed-point methods; (2) cosmological calibration using DESI DR2 + JWST/ACT constraints with explicit evidence tagging; (3) laboratory-scale falsification targets (Casimir / scalar-sector tests) with conservative status (Category D where unverified); and (4) Photonic Isomorphism, interpreting the UIDT vacuum scalar density S(x) as an effective refractive index channel in nonlocal metamaterials, predicting a critical index n_critical = γ ≈ 16.339. The v3.9 manuscript also introduces the torsion binding energy E_T as the missing link between the geometric vacuum scale and the empirically anchored vacuum resonance."
