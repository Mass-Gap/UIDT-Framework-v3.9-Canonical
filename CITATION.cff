abstract: "UIDT v3.7.3 presents the definitive, non-perturbative framework for the unification of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and General Relativity via Information Geometry. This Complete Manuscript establishes a Three-Pillar Architecture: (1) A mathematically closed derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap (1.710 GeV) verified by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem; (2) A cosmological calibration using 2025 DESI DR2 and JWST CCHP data, resolving the Hubble Tension at H0 = 70.4 km/s/Mpc and integrating the Covariant Scalar-Field (CSF) synthesis; (3) A hierarchical vacuum energy suppression mechanism (99-step RG cascade) reducing the cosmological constant discrepancy by ~120 orders of magnitude. The framework includes the 'Supermassive Dark Seeds' (SMDS) hypothesis for early galaxy formation. Scientific integrity is maintained by strictly classifying evidence status (Category A-D) and flagging the perturbative RG-derivation of Gamma as an Open Question."
