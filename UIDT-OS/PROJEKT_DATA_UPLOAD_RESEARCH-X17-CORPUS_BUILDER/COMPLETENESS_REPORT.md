# Research Corpus Completeness Report

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE

## Executive Summary
The UIDT Research Corpus Builder has successfully ingested and processed 100% of the source files from the designated `RAW_DATA` directories. An automated audit confirmed that every input file has a corresponding research unit in the output corpus.

## Scope of Verification

### Input Directories Scanned
1.  `.../chat-gpt-gemini-grokupdates` (28 files)
2.  `.../perplexity-research` (72 files)
**Total Input Files:** 100

### Output Corpus Scanned
-   **Location:** `.../PROJEKT_DATA_UPLOAD_RESEARCH-X17-CORPUS_BUILDER`
-   **Structure:**
    -   `STRATUM_A_GEOMETRY`
    -   `STRATUM_B_LATTICE`
    -   `STRATUM_C_PHENOMENOLOGY`
    -   `STRATUM_D_EPISTEMOLOGY`
    -   `Unclassified`

## Verification Results

| Metric | Count | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Input Files** | 100 | ✅ |
| **Files Found in Output** | 100 | ✅ |
| **Missing Files** | 0 | ✅ |
| **Total Research Units** | 4626 | (Cumulative) |

### Integrity Checks
-   **CSV Handling:** Validated. Complex numerical tables (e.g., `01_borel_transformation_data.csv`) are preserved as Markdown code blocks.
-   **JSON Handling:** Validated. Both structured (Grok/ChatGPT) and unstructured (Perplexity) JSONs are correctly parsed.
-   **Code Handling:** Validated. Python scripts (e.g., `baseline_50dps.py`) are captured as code artifacts.
-   **Text/Markdown:** Validated. All documentation and logs are indexed.

## Conclusion
The Research Corpus is structurally complete and accurately visualizes the entire input dataset. No data loss occurred during the transformation process. The corpus is ready for downstream agents and analysis.

## Integration Log

### 2026-02-23 — Covariant Scalar-Field Unification (Phase 1)
- CSF Phase 1 formally integrated into the core topology.
- Maps exclusively to `STRATUM_C_PHENOMENOLOGY` and framework modules (`covariant_unification.py`).
- **Claim Linked:** `UIDT-C-043` (Category `[C]`).

### 2026-02-23 — Topological Vacuum Harmonics (Plan vx5)

**New claims registered:**
- UIDT-C-047 [D] — "Magic 24" Harmonic Resonance (pseudoscalar glueball / f_vac ≈ 24)
- UIDT-C-048 [E] — BRST DoF Reduction Hypothesis (118 → 99)

**New files:**
- `STRATUM_B_LATTICE/TKT-104_StringTheoryBridge_20260223.md` — Formal research document
- `verification/scripts/verify_brst_dof_reduction.py` — Systematic BRST hypothesis enumeration

**Modified files:**
- `modules/harmonic_predictions.py` — Added `check_harmonic_24_resonance()` with [D] labeling
- `verification/scripts/verify_topological_discoveries.py` — Added Section 4 (Harmonic-24)
- `docs/limitations.md` — Added BRST Hypothesis 4 to L5
- `UIDT-OS/LEDGER/CLAIMS.json` — Registered UIDT-C-047, UIDT-C-048; total claims → 48

**Epistemic note:** "Magic 24" corrected from "parameter-free" to "numerical coincidence [D]". Factor 1.5 in `predict_glueball_pseudoscalar()` explicitly labeled as empirical.
