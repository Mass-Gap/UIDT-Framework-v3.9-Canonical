# Notes:
#   - Agreement_sigma = |w_a(UIDT) - w_a(data)| / sigma(data)  [heuristic z-score, no correlation modeling]
#   - All cosmology comparisons capped at Evidence Category [C]
#   - UIDT w_a prediction: w_a = -delta * L^4 with delta = 0.00028757, L = 8.2
#   - UIDT values are calibrated interpretive mappings, not independent measurements
