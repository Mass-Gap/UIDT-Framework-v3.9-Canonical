    "name": "UIDT v3.9: Unified Information-Density Theory - Complete Manuscript (Clean State)",
    "description": "The UIDT v3.9 software suite provides the canonical implementation and verification environment for the Unified Information-Density Theory. It includes the Python solver for the parameter-free derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap (Δ≈1.710 GeV) and the Universal Gamma Invariant (γ≈16.339). This Complete Manuscript establishes the Four-Pillar Architecture and formalizes the CSF-UIDT synthesis (Covariant Scalar-Field unification), adding Photonic Isomorphism (Pillar IV) as an analog verification channel with n_critical = γ and ε_r ≈ γ^2. The suite simulates the 99-step Renormalization Group (RG) cascade for vacuum energy suppression with holographic normalization (π⁻²), calibrates cosmological observables (H₀, S₈, w(z)) against DESI DR2, and models Supermassive Dark Seeds (SMDS). Scientific integrity is maintained via strict evidence classification (A–D, plus D+ for analog verification). Clean State established after v3.3 withdrawal.",
