    "description": "The UIDT v3.7.2 software suite provides the canonical implementation and verification environment for the Unified Information-Density Theory. It includes the Python solver for the parameter-free derivation of the Yang-Mills Mass Gap (1.710 GeV) and the Universal Gamma Invariant (16.339). This Complete Manuscript establishes the 'Three-Pillar Architecture' and formalizes the 'CSF-UIDT Synthesis' (Covariant Scalar-Field Unification). The suite simulates the 99-step Renormalization Group (RG) cascade for vacuum energy suppression with holographic normalization (π⁻²), calibrates cosmological observables (H₀, S₈, w(z)) against 2025 DESI DR2 data, and models Supermassive Dark Seeds (SMDS). Version 3.6.1 implements critical corrections: VEV rectified to 47.7 MeV, Casimir effect reclassified to 'predicted, unverified' (Category D), and H₀ unified to 70.4 km/s/Mpc. Clean State established after v3.3 withdrawal.",

    "releaseNotes": "Version 3.6.1 - Clean State Implementation: Critical corrections applied: (1) VEV rectified to 47.7 MeV throughout all code and documentation; (2) Casimir anomaly status reclassified from 'confirmed' to 'predicted, unverified' (Category D) to maintain scientific integrity; (3) Hubble constant H₀ unified to 70.4 km/s/Mpc across all computations; (4) Holographic normalization factor (π⁻²) explicitly documented in vacuum energy calculation. This version formally supersedes v3.3 (withdrawn) and establishes permanent canonical state under full personal control."
